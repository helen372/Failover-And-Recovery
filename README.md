# Failover-And-Recovery
 In this project I created highly available solutions to common use cases. I build a Multi-Availability Zone, Multi-Region database and used it in multiple geographically separate AWS regions. I also build a website hosting solution that is versioned so that any data destruction and accidents can be quickly and easily undone.
